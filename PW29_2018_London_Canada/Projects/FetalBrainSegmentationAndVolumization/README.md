## Fetal Brain Segmentation and Volumization    

## Key Investigators
- Estee Goldberg (Biomedical Engineering, Western University)
- Denis Kikinov (Software Engineering, Western University) 


# Project Description
<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. --> 
This will be a tool to segment the fetal brain from a fetal MRI. Afterwards the fetal brain will be compiled into a brain volume for statistical analysis.


## Objective
1. Take a fetal MRI image
1. Segment the fetal brain
1. Produce a brain volume for the segmented brain 

## Approach and Plan

1. Search for current segmentation tools and test if they function on fetal brains.
1. If no current solution exists attempt to create a tool for assisted manual segmentation.
1. Merge segmented slices into one volume.
